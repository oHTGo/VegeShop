## How to run

- I built this application with Netbean 8.2 so maybe you can use Netbean IDE to make it more easily to import project.
- If you use other IDE such as Eclipse or Intellij IDEA, you will need to find the way to config this project before use.
- After import this project to IDE, adding JSTL support (almost all IDE support adding JSTL lib) and all external library in `lib`.
- Then, copy the file `EnvConfig.java.sample` to `EnvConfig.java` and you change some information in `EnvConfig.java`.
- Finally, setup database with my `database.sql` scripts.
- That's all, enjoy VegeShop!.
